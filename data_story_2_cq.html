			<h1>Roosevelt Blvd. might get new speed-detection cameras, but is it the most dangerous road in Philadelphia?</h1>
			<p>Find out which roads to avoid during your daily commute.</p>
			<h3>By Christine Quach</h3><br>
			<p>
				The Pennsylvania Senate recently passed a bill approving the addition of speed-detection cameras to Roosevelt Blvd., which is known to be one of the most accident-prone roads in the Philadelphia area. Drivers going 11 miles above the speed limit will receive a fine of up to $150, as reported by 6abc.<br><br>
				The bill paves a way for Vision Zero Action Plan, a pilot program that is intended to reduce traffic deaths to zero by 2030, according to WHYY. This plan involves improvements to both street design and traffic law enforcement as well as increased road safety education.

	<caption><em>Above is an interactive map detailing the location of fatal accidents on Roosevelt Blvd. from 2015 to 2017. Not shown is the overall number of deaths on the Boulevard during that time period, which is 21.</em></caption><br>
	<div id="article"><p>
		Roosevelt Blvd.’s future results will determine whether or not speed-detection cameras are effective enough to apply to other accident-prone areas in the city. From 2015 to 2017, PennDOT's open crash data shows that there has been 3,676 reported accidents in the Philadelphia area. Of those accidents, 1,140 occurred on Roosevelt Blvd.<br><br>
		Due to its 12-lane structure and speeds reaching up to 70 mph, Roosevelt Blvd. has become a hotspot for major injuries and fatalities. The major road runs from the Schuylkill Expressway in Fairmount Park through North Philadelphia to the end of the city line. In 2004, red light cameras were installed in an attempt to reduce the number of accidents. From the last two years, not considering 2018, there have been 43 major injuries and 21 fatalities from car-related accidents on the Boulevard, as it’s colloquially called. These incidents involved pedestrians and bicyclists as well.

		Aside from Roosevelt Blvd., City Ave. has the second-most number of motor vehicle accidents. In 2017, there were 411 reported accidents, and about 25% of those accidents involved roads intersecting with City Ave. Intersections at Roosevelt Blvd. made up the remaining 75% of accidents, approximately.<br><br>
		Overall, the majority of car accidents occurred during morning and evening rush hours, which are times when traffic is heaviest. This is due to the typical nine-to-five work schedule that many Philadelphia and other surrounding area residents adhere to. Rush hours in Philadelphia are from 7:00am to 9:30am and 4:30pm to 6:00pm. Accidents peaked at the times between 8:00am and 9:00am as well as 4:00pm and 5:00pm. It seems that a higher amount of traffic correlates to a higher risk of getting into a car accident. This correlation is in relation to general factors without considering unideal weather conditions.
