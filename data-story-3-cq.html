		As you’re flying home to visit your relatives over the holidays, one common question might crop up from your well-meaning relatives, “When are you getting married?” Whether you’re in a long-term relationship, just starting out in one, or happily single, this popular topic tends to be on the tips of everyone’s tongues, especially since <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/388440/most-popular-months-for-engagement-in-the-united-states/#0">December is the most popular month to get engaged.</a> There are a few rising trends that are explaining why you might not be ready to get married, if at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		Americans are getting married at a much later age than their past generations. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2018, the average marital age of men and women are 29.8 and 27.8 years old, respectively. Just ten years ago, in 2008, the average marital ages were 27.6 and 25.9 years old.

	<p>Out of the surveyed pool, 35.2% of men and 29.5% of women have never been married.</p>

	<p>
		Many factors play into a delay in getting married. One simple aspect is our improved lifespan. With the help of advancing medicine and technology, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274513/life-expectancy-in-north-america/">average American lifespan is currently 78.5 years.</a> In the past, people married much younger because they died younger as well. Illnesses aside, there is no sense of urgency since there is more time to reach personal goals.  
	</p>

	<p>
		A rise in education is also a contributing factor to a later marital age. According to the Center for Disease Control, 60.2% of men and 58.6% of women ages 25 and over were pursuing or already received a college degree in 2016. The societal shift in focus toward education and careers has placed more emphasis on financial success. The <a href="https://www.phillymag.com/philadelphia-wedding/2016/04/05/wowza-the-average-cost-of-a-wedding-is-higher-than-ever/">average wedding costs around $35,000</a>, so securing a high-paying job with a profitable degree is surely highly prioritized. Wedding costs are only the beginning. The costs of supporting a growing family and buying a home have only risen.

	<p>
		Aside from education, many people just don’t see the need to get married. In a long-term relationship, there is less emphasis and pressure on having kids or reaching other typical marriage milestones. As reported by the <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/06/number-of-u-s-adults-cohabiting-with-a-partner-continues-to-rise-especially-among-those-50-and-older/">Pew Research Center</a>, more and more people are cohabitating with partners rather than spouses. Since 2007, the number of cohabitating couples in the U.S. has risen 29%. Interestingly, 52% of cohabitators have never been married.

		So when you're facing the onslaught of marriage questions from your family this upcoming Christmas, just sit back and smile. Marriage is often a personal choice with many factors to consider, and if you decide that it's not something you're interested in, here are the facts to support it.
